# **Summer Research - Small World Networks**

## _A website for the SURF 2020 program in Small World Networks_

> We are surrounded by networks, including those of social, biological and physical nature. Some of these networks have a random behavior, however, the data that flows through them exhibits very special features. The objective of this project is to study a particular class, called small world networks, from a mathematical perspective, as well as their connections with dynamics, statistical analysis and physics.
